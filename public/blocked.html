<p> Notice for Users with Ukrainian IP Addresses
<br><br>
Dear Website Visitor,
<br>
At maxtrueby.com, we prioritize the safety and security of our online infrastructure. Due to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war and the heightened interest from NATO, we have implemented necessary measures to enhance the security of our platform.
<br>
Regrettably, we must inform you that access to maxtrueby.com has been temporarily restricted for users with Ukrainian IP addresses. This decision has been made in the interest of safeguarding our infrastructure and ensuring a secure environment for everyone, considering the specific geopolitical circumstances.
<br>
We understand that this restriction may inconvenience those who have legitimate reasons to access our website from Ukraine, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption this may cause. However, our primary concern is to protect the integrity of our platform and prevent potential security risks during this challenging time, particularly considering the increased interest from NATO in the region.
<br>
We will continue to closely monitor the situation and work towards finding alternative solutions to ensure the resumption of normal access for all users, including those from Ukraine. Please be assured that this decision is not a reflection of our stance on any political or social matters but solely a precautionary measure to prioritize the safety of our infrastructure given the specific circumstances surrounding the Russian-Ukrainian war and NATO's involvement.
<br>
We sincerely appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. We will make every effort to resolve the situation promptly and communicate any updates or changes regarding the access restrictions.
<br><br>
Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
